# Mobile Ordering App 📲
This is the front end of our Senior Design Capstone Project 
## Description 
Our goal is to develop an app that minimizes the use of multiple ordering systems, provides contactless ordering, allows restaurant owners to protect their business and customers from COVID-19 while providing a resource to help small businesses reach more people all at the same time. We want customers to be able to find small businesses quickly and easily without having to look through multiple webpage and maps, with our app providing a clean list and map view for the customer to utilize in their search for their next meal. Customers will also be able to see fully up-to-date information regarding menus and hours, as well as reviews left by previous customers. Once the customer has decided on their restaurant of choice, they can interact with the app to complete the ordering process, including payment, all in one place. They can then stop by their favorite restaurant, grab their meal, and enjoy, all with safety as a number one priority. In the world of Covid-19, everyone is looking to keep safety first, and our app is designed to reduce the amount of hassle required for small businesses to upkeep that and allows them to keep doing what they do best.
